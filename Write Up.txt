
Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).


Data Sources: https://openweathermap.org/current, https://openweathermap.org/current

Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
Your project must use 2 or more sources of data. We recommend the following sites to use as sources of data:
1. Kaggle - csv
2. 14ers - csv
Data Sources: https://openweathermap.org/current, https://openweathermap.org/curren
You can also use APIs or data scraped from the web. However, get approval from your instructor first. Again, there is only a week to complete this!
DATA (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
Production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
Final Table.

We used WEATHER MAP API through panda extension
API: bf92df9976c606200718381d7f1494 (weather)
Data Cleanup & Analysis
1. Found/ Merged CSVs
2. Remove special characters from CSV 
3. Used Pandas Weather API - searches current weather amongst all 14ers
4. Used converted API to  JSON text then to Pandas
5. had to remove spaces from table names to run SQL script
6. Had to clean and transform the csvs we created from our data  by removing hyphens or spaces for primary key usage
Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and 

document the following:
